# üê≥ Docker Configuration for KloverBuy  

This documentation explains the **Docker configuration** for the **KloverBuy** project. The Dockerfile optimizes the application for **performance, scalability, and reliability**, ensuring **seamless deployment** across environments.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Dockerfile Explanation**  

The following sections explain the key components of the **Dockerfile**:

### **1. Base Image**  
- **Base Image**: `node:20-alpine`  
- **Why Alpine?**  
  - It is a **lightweight and secure** Node.js environment.
  - Reduces **container size**, leading to **faster deployments**.

---

### **2. Set Working Directory**  
- `WORKDIR /app`  
- Defines the `/app` directory inside the container as the **default working directory**.
- All subsequent commands execute from this location.

---

### **3. Copy Dependency Files**  
- `COPY package*.json ./`  
- Copies **`package.json` and `package-lock.json`** before installing dependencies.
- Ensures that **Docker caching** is optimized for fast builds.

---

### **4. Install Node.js Dependencies**  
- `RUN npm install --production`  
- Installs only the **necessary production dependencies**.
- Keeps the **Docker image size minimal** and prevents unnecessary package installations.

---

### **5. Copy Application Files**  
- `COPY . .`  
- Copies the entire **application source code** into the container‚Äôs working directory.

---

### **6. Expose Port**  
- `EXPOSE 5000`  
- Opens **port 5000** for incoming traffic.
- **Port 5000** is used by the **Node.js API server**.

---

### **7. CMD - Application Start Command**  
- `CMD ["node", "server.js"]`  
- Starts the **Node.js API** using the `server.js` file.
- This ensures that the application **runs automatically** when the container starts.

---

## üìä **Key Highlights:**
‚úÖ Lightweight Image: Uses node:20-alpine for faster build times.
‚úÖ Optimized Builds: Ensures efficient caching by copying dependencies first.
‚úÖ Minimal Image Size: Prevents unnecessary files from being added to the image.
‚úÖ Port Configuration: Exposes port 5000 for the backend API.
‚úÖ Automated Startup: Uses CMD ["node", "server.js"] for auto-execution.
